# Configuration Management Plan for Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Power BI project titled 'COVID Data Project for Software Testing'. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Configuration Management (CM) principles in managing the development and updates of a Power BI dashboard.

## Purpose of Configuration Management
Configuration Management is used in this project to:
- Ensure consistency and traceability of changes to the project files.
- Maintain version control to track project progress over time.
- Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub as the CM tools.
- Provide an organized and structured repository for project management and submissions.

## Git Commands Used
The following Git commands were used to manage this repository:
- Initialize the repository: `git init`
- Stage files: `git add .`
- Commit changes:`git commit -m "Commit message"`
- Push changes to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`
- Check status: `git status`

## Branching Strategy
- Main Branch (`main`): All stable and production-ready files are pushed to this branch.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Configuration Management Plan.
- `COVID_DATA_PROJECT_SOFTWARE_TESTING.pbix`: Power BI report.

## Future Improvements
- Introduce branching for feature updates.
- Automate processes using GitHub Actions.
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` file for update tracking.
